# My C++ Project Blog : The Physics Engine

Welcome to my blog! Here you can find my project's executables along with descriptions of what each one does.

### **First sample - `the planets`**
This is the first sample of my Physics Engine. It shows circles considered as planets, each with a mass, radius, position, velocity, and acceleration.

The main interest of this sample is to demonstrate the basic physics formula of Newton's law, showing how these planets revolve around a center, which we consider as a sun. This means that gravity is applied to the planets towards the sun, and we need to perform a simple calculation using that force and the angular velocity to make the planets orbit the sun, which is our objective.

### **Second Sample - `the trigger collisions`**
This second sample is designed to show how a trigger collision works. A trigger collision happens when two objects touch each other but don't bounce off each other; they typically pass through each other.

In this sample, you'll find a window where some circles are moving, and when they enter a trigger collision situation, their colors turn red until they move apart.

However, due to limited knowledge, there's a small issue: when more than two circles collide with each other, one of the circles will most likely return to its original color even if the collision is still occurring.

### **Third Sample - `the actual collisions`**
This third sample is designed to show how a normal collision works. A normal collision occurs when two objects touch each other and most likely bounce off each other, depending on a restitution value. This value can range from 0, where no energy is retained after the collision, to 1, where all the energy is retained. For example, in real life, this value never reaches 1, but only approaches it depending on the situation and the objects involved.

In this sample, you'll find a window where some circles are moving alongside another form called an AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), which is essentially a rectangle with defined bounces and no rotation.

When two circles, two AABBs, or one circle and one AABB collide, they will bounce off each other based on their respective masses. If their masses are too high, they will "slide" towards each other instead of bouncing. Similarly, if their masses are too low, the collision may not be acknowledged at all.
