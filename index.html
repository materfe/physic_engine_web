        <h1>My C++ Project Blog: The Physics Engine</h1>
        <p>Goals of this project</p>
    </header>

    <p>In this blog, I share various physics engine samples I've developed. Each sample comes with a detailed description about it's purpose and its working proces. At the end of the page comes a downloadable executable. Let's dive in!</p>

<header>
    <h2>First Sample: *The Planets*</h2>
    <p>Quick introduction to physics</p>
</header>       
 
	<p>This first sample demonstrates the foundational principles of physics through a simulation of planets orbiting a sun. The movement is driven by **Newton's law of gravitation**, which states:
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
        F = G * (m1 * m2) / r²
    </p>
    <p>
        Where:
        <ul>
            <li><b>F</b> is the gravitational force.</li>
            <li><b>G</b> is the gravitational constant.</li>
            <li><b>m1</b> and <b>m2</b> are the masses of the two objects.</li>
            <li><b>r</b> is the distance between the objects.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<header>
<p>Explanationof the working process</p>
</header>
    <p>
        Using this formula, the simulation calculates the gravitational pull between the "planets" (circles) and a "sun" (center point). **Note** : in this sample, planets are only attracted to the main point (sun) and not ot each other as well.

The library **SDL2** is used for rendering, handling graphical elements like drawing the planets and their paths. SDL2 enables smooth animations and efficient handling of window creation and event processing. 

To allow such a rendering, basic mathematical operations are applied to compute multiple variables such as acceleration, velocity, and position for each frame, ensuring realistic movement.
    </p>
   
<header>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</header>

<p>
This first sample is an efficient way to show the apllication of fondamental physics through a coded program based on a real life thing like planets and our solar system in general. 
    </p>

    <h2>Second Sample: *Trigger Collisions*</h2>
	<p>Quick description</p>
</header>

    <p>
        This second sample explores trigger collisions, where objects such as circles detect contact with each others. In the simulation, moving circles change color to red upon trigger collision.
</p>

<p class="issue">
     **However, the sample has a limitation: if multiple objects collide, some detections may fail due to overlapping events**.
    </p>

   <header>
<p>Explanation of the working process</p>
</header>
    <p>
In this sample, we have to calculate if two circles are colliding together. To do so, we use a formula such as :
<p class="formula">
    d = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
</p>

<p>
        Where:
        <ul>
            <li><b>d</b> is the distance between the two circles.</li>
            <li><b>x1 and y1</b> are the coordinates of the first circle's center.</li>
            <li><b>x2 and y2</b> are the coordinates of the second circle's center.</li>
        </ul>
</p>


After being able to learn and use formulas like this one above, being able to show a trigger collision becomes pretty simple.

This sample requires an implementation of **Colliders**. A distinct part from the body of our shapes that allows to manipulate collision effects thought a **Trigger event**.

Just like the previous sample, this also uses **SDL2** for the graphical rendering.
            </p>

<header>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</header>

<p>
This second sample is an efficient way to show how trigger collisions works thought a simple example, a basic geometrical formula and an implementation of colliders.
    </p>





    <h2>Third Sample: *Actual Collisions*</h2>
    <p>
        Here, I present a sample focusing on realistic collisions. Objects such as circles and Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) interact based on their mass and a restitution value, determining the "bounciness" of collisions. The simulation showcases elastic and inelastic collisions, sliding interactions, and how mass impacts collision outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This sample bridges theoretical physics and practical simulation, offering a deeper understanding of collision mechanics.
