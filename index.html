        <p>Goals of this project</p>
    </header>

    <p>In this blog, I share various physics engine samples I've developed. Each sample comes with a detailed description about it's purpose and its working proces. At the end of the page comes a downloadable executable. Let's dive in!</p>

    <h2>First Sample: *The Planets*</h2>
    <p>Quick introduction to physics</p>
</header>    


<div class="video-container">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline width="100%" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">

</div>   
 
	<p>This first sample demonstrates the foundational principles of physics through a simulation of planets orbiting a sun. The movement is driven by **Newton's law of gravitation**, which states:
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
        F = G * (m1 * m2) / r²
    </p>
    <p>
        Where:
        <ul>
            <li><b>F</b> is the gravitational force.</li>
            <li><b>G</b> is the gravitational constant.</li>
            <li><b>m1</b> and <b>m2</b> are the masses of the two objects.</li>
            <li><b>r</b> is the distance between the objects.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<header>
<p>Explanationof the working process</p>
</header>
    <p>
        Using this formula, the simulation calculates the gravitational pull between the "planets" (circles) and a "sun" (center point). **Note** : in this sample, planets are only attracted to the main point (sun) and not ot each other as well.

The library **SDL2** is used for rendering, handling graphical elements like drawing the planets and their paths. SDL2 enables smooth animations and efficient handling of window creation and event processing. 

To allow such a rendering, basic mathematical operations are applied to compute multiple variables such as acceleration, velocity, and position for each frame, ensuring realistic movement.
    </p>
   
<header>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</header>

<p>
This first sample is an efficient way to show the apllication of fondamental physics through a coded program based on a real life thing like planets and our solar system in general.

    <h2>Second Sample: *Trigger Collisions*</h2>
	<p>Quick description</p>
</header>


<div class="video-container">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline width="100%" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
        <source src=trigger.mp4 type="video/mp4">

    </video>
</div> 

    <p>
        This second sample explores trigger collisions, where objects such as circles detect contact with each others. In the simulation, moving circles change color to red upon trigger collision.
</p>

<p class="issue">
     **However, the sample has a limitation: if multiple objects collide, some detections may fail due to overlapping events**.
    </p>

   <header>
<p>Explanation of the working process</p>
</header>
    <p>
In this sample, we have to calculate if two circles are colliding together. To do so, we use a formula such as :
<p class="formula">
    d = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
</p>

<p>
        Where:
        <ul>
            <li><b>d</b> is the distance between the two circles.</li>
            <li><b>x1 and y1</b> are the coordinates of the first circle's center.</li>
            <li><b>x2 and y2</b> are the coordinates of the second circle's center.</li>
        </ul>
</p>


After being able to learn and use formulas like this one above, being able to show a trigger collision becomes pretty simple.

This sample requires an implementation of **Colliders**. A distinct part from the body of our shapes that allows to manipulate collision effects thought a **Trigger event**.

Just like the previous sample, this also uses **SDL2** for the graphical rendering.
            </p>

<header>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</header>

<p>
This second sample is an efficient way to show how trigger collisions works thought a simple example, a basic geometrical formula and an implementation of colliders.
    </p>




<header>
<h2>Third Sample: *Actual Collisions*</h2>
<p>Quick Introduction</p>
</header>
    
<div class="video-container">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline width="100%" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
        <source src=collision.mp4 type="video/mp4">

</div> 


     <p>
        This final sample showcases **realistic collisions** between objects, including circles and **AABBs** (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes). An AABB is a rectangle whose edges are always aligned with the coordinate axes and it also can't rotate, a rotating AABB is called an **OBB** (oriented bounding box).  This makes AABBs a common choice for collision detection in 2D environments.
    </p>

<p class="issue">
     **However, this sample also has a limitation: if the velocity of the two colliding objects are too high, they pass through each other**.
    </p>


<header>
<p>Explanation of the working process</p>
</header>

    <p>
There are three steps to this sample : resolve calculations for two circles, then for two AABBs and finally, for one circle and one AABB.        
</p>

 <p>
For two circles, the collision detection is similar to the trigger sample but it includes calculations for velocity and mass to determine the post-collision behavior. If one circle is heavier than an other one, it won't be too much affected by the collision.
    </p>

 <p>
For two AABBs, the detection for the collision is easier since we know the exact bounds of the shape we choose. All that's left is the calculus of the velocity based on the mass of the two colliding shapes.
    </p>

<p>
Here is an example of the used **formula to modify the velocity of our shapes :**
    </p>


<p class="formula">
    v'_A = [(m_A - y* m_B) * v_A + (1 + y) * m_B * v_B] / (m_A + m_B)
</p>
<p>
    Here’s what each term in the formula represents:
    <ul>
        <li><b>v'_A</b>: The final velocity of object A after the collision.</li>
        <li><b>v_A</b> and <b>v_B</b>: The initial velocities of objects A and B, respectively.</li>
        <li><b>m_A</b> and <b>m_B</b>: The masses of objects A and B, respectively.</li>
        <li><b>y</b>: The coefficient of restitution, a value between 0 and 1 that defines how elastic the collision is. The closer this value is to 1, the more energy will be kept after the collision</li>
    </ul>
</p>


    <p>
For the collision between one circle and one AABB, we use a little trick : we make an AABB out of the circle's bounds and do the calculation out of this. However, since our real shape is a circle, it needs and implementation that restrains the corners of the made AABB.
    </p>

    <p>
Just like before, **SDL2** is used again to render objects and handle frame updates.  
</p>

<header>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</header>

<p>
This last sample is an efficient way to show how physical collisions works through a simple example, some circles and AABBs to demonstrate some physics formulas and applications.
</p>

<header>
        <h1>Final conclusion</h1>
</header>

<p>
This Project was an interactive and effecient way to learn basic physics formulas and knowledge on top of C++ programming language knowledge. Due to the remaining issues, i intent to keep working on it and polishing the work done.
